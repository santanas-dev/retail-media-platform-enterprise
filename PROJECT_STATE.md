## Current HEAD

| main    | 4db6dc0  | v0.7 published |

## Active Workstreams

### H0 — Flaky test_backoff_respected_on_second_run ✅ RESOLVED
- **Verdict: confirmed timing flake, not real backoff regression.**
- Root cause: `_make_engine_and_clean()` only deleted `test.relay.%` events. Foreign pending/failed outbox events from other test suites (pop, campaigns) survived cleanup and consumed the shared `fail_next(1)` token.
- Fix (SHA 39dc8bc): `_make_engine_and_clean()` now deletes ALL pending/failed events regardless of event_type. Added +1s margin + 0.1s sleep in per-test isolation.
- CI proof: Run #29515994509 — 34/34 green, behavioural success.
- 10/10 local, 9/9 outbox relay suite.

### C1 — Creative Moderation + Campaign Approval RLS 🟡
- Fix applied on develop (SHA 4adde45 → 39dc8bc)
- 4 endpoints under NOBYPASSRLS, 8 behavioural tests (all pass)
- **NOT CLOSED — merge to main after D2 completes**
- No remaining blockers: ADR-008 gate GREEN ✅ (H0 resolved)
- Bug fixed: `AdvertiserOrganization.name` → `legal_name` (4 places)
- Seed gap closed: `creatives.moderate` in role_permissions for system_admin/security_admin

### C2 — LDAPS certificate validation ✅ RESOLVED
- **Verdict: real bug — two paths silently dropped TLS to CERT_NONE.**
- Root cause 1: `_connect()` gated TLS creation on `ad_use_tls` flag. When False, `tls=None` and ldap3 defaulted to `CERT_NONE`.
- Root cause 2: `elif` chain had no fallback — unrecognised `cert_val` (typo, etc.) left `tls_kwargs` empty → `tls=None`.
- Fix (SHA 47e7d44): removed `ad_use_tls` gate; TLS always created from cert policy. Added fail-secure `else` → `CERT_REQUIRED`. Fixed no-op test `test_connect_tls_required_uses_cert_required`.
- New tests: unknown cert_val → CERT_REQUIRED; ad_use_tls=False → still CERT_REQUIRED; source-inspection: fail-secure else, no ad_use_tls gate.
- CI proof: Run #29519917049 — 34/34 green, ADR-008 behavioural success.
- ldap3 already in requirements.txt and CI — no dependency fix needed.
- Auth model unchanged beyond LDAPS cert validation scope.

### D1 — Extracted TZ table reattachment ✅ RESOLVED
- **Verdict: documentation integrity fix — tables divorced from sections.**
- Root cause: sequential extraction numbering did not match section numbering. Gaps at sections 9, 13, 21, 22 shifted all subsequent assignments.
- Fix (SHA 9216a54): content-based semantic mapping of 36 tables to 25 sections. Section 14 now correctly shows security requirements (auth/RBAC/devices/API/personal data), not device statuses.
- 0 orphan `## TABLE` headers remain. Original `.docx` untouched.

### D2 — Roadmap sync with PROJECT_STATE 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- Roadmap `roadmap-s020-2026-07-10.xlsx` has stale statuses: S-036 marked done but C1 not closed; S-048 marked done but C2 was Critical.
- Fix: align roadmap statuses with PROJECT_STATE truth, add behavioral-proof alignment rule to `roadmap-maintenance-rules.md`.

## Completed (Player Blockers A1–A3)

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| A1 S-086 | Inventory availability forecast | ✅ |
| A2 S-087 | Sold-out alternatives | ✅ |
| A3 S-088 | Rules management UI | ✅ |

## Pending

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| A4 S-089 | Inventory simulation | ⏳ |
| A5 S-090 | Campaign dashboard | ⏳ |
| A6 S-091 | Emergency controls | ⏳ |

## Environment

- **PostgreSQL:** Docker `rmp-phase1-postgres-1` (port 5432)
- **App role:** `retail_media_app` (NOBYPASSRLS)
- **Owner role:** `retail_media_owner` (fixtures)
- **Behavioural:** `RUN_BEHAVIORAL_TESTS=1` + BEHAVIORAL_DB_URL + BEHAVIORAL_APP_DB_URL

## Constraints

- `main` = stable releases, `develop` = active integration
- Protected: `.env`, Docker/deploy scripts, destructive migrations
- RLS on all tenant-scoped tables, NOBYPASSRLS enforced
- Only Hermes pushes to GitHub; ASUSTOR = local canon
