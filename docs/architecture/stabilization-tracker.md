| S-006a | Delivery architecture lock | P2 | 🔒 locked | — | ADR-016 accepted: delivery trigger, eligibility, target resolution, manifest schema, versioning, outbox events, observability, security, phase split (4.2b→4.2e), behavioral proof requirements | — |
| S-006b | Delivery DB/model foundation | P2 | ✅ done | — | Migration 008, 5 ORM models (DeliveryPlan/Manifest/Surface/Asset/Attempt), 7 repository helpers, 16 unit + 10 behavioral tests. Commits: `46cfe71` + `137ae0b` | — |
| S-006c | Manifest generator worker skeleton | P2 | ✅ done | — | `packages/domain/delivery.py` (776 lines): eligibility, target resolution, `compute_manifest_id` + `compute_campaign_version_hash`, manifest JSON gen, delivery_plan/manifest persistence, `delivery.manifest.generated`/`failed` outbox, plan idempotency. 25 unit + 12 behavioral tests.

| S-006e | Runtime simulator safety proofs | P2 | ✅ done | — | `packages/runtime/simulator.py` (505 lines): ADR-013 safety simulator — manifest apply (validate/secrets/device_id/version/signature → atomic swap + lkg), kill-switch (4 levels, fail-closed), render slot (6 safety gates), PoP integrity (only after render, dedup, required fields), offline TTL (monotonic, fallback after expiry). 41 unit tests. Commits: `52a50fc` + fix. | Phase 4.3+: PoP ingestion / event delivery |
| S-007c | PoP ingestion endpoint | P3 | ✅ done | — | `POST /api/v1/pop/batch` on control-api, device JWT, 11-step validation (schema/device/dedup/duration/playback/stale/clock_drift/manifest/cross-entity), quarantine 72h, accepted = billing-grade, outbox (pop.event.accepted/quarantined + pop.batch.ingested), dedup flush fix (59060ad), fixture hardening (d1d7bb5), cleanup time fence (d97be76). 29 unit + 27 behavioral tests. Commits: `d1c6e8c` + `d1d7bb5` + `59060ad` + `d97be76`. | Implement 4.3d reporting endpoints |

Campaign ownership guard (`_require_campaign_visible`) — scoped advertiser foreign campaign → 404, admin bypass. CampaignPopSummaryOut/ByDay/BySurface schemas, no PII/secrets. 13 unit + 23 behavioral (8 reporting + 15 scope). P1 fix: `1f3e98d`. Commits: `518475c` + `1f3e98d`. | Implement 4.3e materialized views |
| S-007e | Behavioral PostgreSQL CI gate | P1 | ✅ done | — | `.github/workflows/phase1-ci.yml` — `behavioral-postgres-tests` job: PostgreSQL 16 service, migrations + seed, `RUN_BEHAVIORAL_TESTS=1`, full `tests/behavioral/` suite.
