# Stabilization Tracker — Retail Media Platform Enterprise

| **Last updated:** 2026-07-10
| **Current phase:** S-016 dual auth readiness in progress. Backend pilot delivery chain proven (B1/B2/B3). v0.1 tagged.

## Pilot Backend Readiness (2026-07-09)

**Backend pilot delivery chain proven through device manifest fetch** (9 July 2026 evidence).

Separately covered:
- **Campaign setup/approval APIs** — behavioral tests (42 campaign mutations + 24 approval)
- **Delivery pipeline** — B2 NATS E2E + B3 pilot E2E (opt-in, real NATS + real PostgreSQL)
- **Device manifest fetch** — device-gateway HTTP with device JWT, ETag/304, security audit

**Proven chain:** outbox enqueue → NATS relay → JetStream consumer → manifest generation → device-gateway `/api/v1/device/manifest/latest` HTTP response (200 + correct shape, 304/401 security, no storage secrets).

**Not yet proven (out of scope for backend pilot):**
- Real KSO player/sidecar
- Frontend (advertiser/admin portal)
- Real creative upload/storage/presigned URLs
- Production manifest signing (HMAC placeholder)
- ClickHouse / materialized reporting
- Production deployment/observability hardening

| S-007d | PoP reporting / read models | P3 | ✅ done | — | GET /api/v1/identity/campaigns/{id}/pop/{summary,by-day,by-surface} with JWT + require_scoped_permission("campaigns.read","advertiser") + set_rls_context. 3 repository helpers filtering status='accepted' AND campaign_verified=true AND playback_result='success'. Campaign ownership guard (_require_campaign_visible) — scoped advertiser foreign campaign → 404, admin bypass. CampaignPopSummaryOut/ByDay/BySurface schemas, no PII/secrets. 13 unit + 23 behavioral (8 reporting + 15 scope). P1 fix: 1f3e98d. Commits: 518475c + 1f3e98d. | Implement 4.3e materialized views |
| S-007e | Behavioral PostgreSQL CI gate | P1 | ✅ done | — | .github/workflows/phase1-ci.yml — behavioral-postgres-tests job: PostgreSQL 16 service, two-role setup (owner for migrations, retail_media_app NOBYPASSRLS for runtime), migrations + seed + explicit GRANT, zero-tests-passed guard, blocks merge on failure. Local runner: scripts/ci/behavioral-postgres-checks.sh with superuser/BYPASSRLS warning + zero-test guard. RLS-proof runtime role verified in CI. | — |
| S-010 | Auth login rate limiting (ADR-006 §8) | P1 | ✅ done | — | count_recent_failed_attempts in repository, guard in AuthService.login() before user lookup, 429 on exceeding 5 attempts/15min window, rate-limited attempts recorded in login_attempts for audit, no user enumeration in 429 response. Config: login_rate_limit_max_attempts=5, login_rate_limit_window_minutes=15. 5 unit + 4 behavioral tests. | — |
| S-011 | CORS baseline | P1 | ✅ done | — | SecurityConfig: cors_allowed_origins, cors_allow_credentials, cors_allowed_methods, cors_allowed_headers. Dev defaults: localhost:5173. Production: requires explicit CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, rejects ["*"] + allow_credentials=True. CORSMiddleware on control-api only. 10 tests (4 header + 6 config validation). | — |
| S-012 | Outbox relay + orchestration runtime wiring | P1 | ✅ done | — | OutboxRelay poller with fetch_pending_events (time-fence next_attempt_at <= NOW()), exponential backoff, dead-letter. Real JetStream publisher: NatsJetStreamPublisher with Nats-Msg-Id dedup, fail-fast on missing NATS, Stub fallback only via OUTBOX_RELAY_ALLOW_STUB=true. Campaign event handler: 7 ADR-016 delivery triggers → generate_manifests_for_campaign, safe no-op on unknown/missing campaign_id. Real JetStream consumer: NatsJetStreamCampaignConsumer — pull-based, durable, campaign.> wildcard, ack after commit, nak with delay on failure, term on malformed (poison pill). Worker integration: relay + consumer run as independent asyncio.create_task(), health endpoint always available. E2E NATS test (test_nats_e2e.py, opt-in, RUN_NATS_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1): proves outbox→relay→NATS→consumer→manifest generated→DB row. Pilot E2E smoke (test_pilot_e2e.py, opt-in): extends B2 path through device-gateway HTTP fetch with device JWT, ETag/304, 401, manifest shape + secrets audit. 88 unit + 20 behavioral + 2 integration (opt-in) tests. | Production: NATS stream/consumer provisioning, deployment config, observability (metrics, alerts) |
| S-013 | Production readiness — provisioning + observability | P1 | ✅ done | — | NATS provisioning: packages/services/jetstream_provisioning.py — idempotent stream/consumer create/update, check_stream_exists(), safe to re-run. Startup checks: _run_provisioning() — NATS_AUTO_PROVISION=true auto-provisions, otherwise fail-fast with clear message if stream missing. Health/readiness: GET /health/ready returns DB+NATS+publisher+consumer status + relay/consumer/manifest counters. GET /health/live returns liveness probe. Thread-safe HealthState singleton with locking. Observability: relay published/failed counters, consumer acked/nakd/terminated/errors counters, manifest success/failed/skipped counters, periodic summary logger (60s). Runbook: docs/runbook/delivery-runtime.md — quick-start, env vars, provisioning, health checks, diagnostic checklist. 35 unit tests. | Prometheus metrics, alert rules |
| S-014 | Pilot reliability hardening | P1 | ✅ done | — | Real DB readiness: check_db_health() connectivity check at startup replaces unconditional set_db_ok(True). Fail-fast with safe message (no DATABASE_URL in errors). Dead-letter counter: mark_event_failed returns bool; relay bumps bump_relay_dead_letter() on True. Behavioral tests for transient/max-attempt/not-found. Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers → stop relay loop (OutboxRelay.stop()), stop consumer loop, drain/disconnect NATS publisher + consumer, log shutdown steps. Health state → shutting_down status → /health/ready returns 503. Shutdown idempotent (safe to call twice). Consumer DB check: _start_consumer() also verifies DB via check_db_health(). 86 unit tests (relay 35 + readiness 51). Behavioral: 0 run (requires PostgreSQL). | Prometheus metrics/alerts (deferred) |
| S-008 | DB write RLS WITH CHECK | P0 | ✅ done | — | Migration 010: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE RLS policies on all 7 campaign-domain tables. WITH CHECK using app.rmp_scope_advertiser_ids + admin bypass. Direct + via-campaign patterns. CI fix: behavioral tests now run with DATABASE_URL=retail_media_app (NOBYPASSRLS). S-008 gate verifies rolsuper=false, rolbypassrls=false before tests. Tests: 4 behavioral RLS write enforcement tests (TestRLSWriteEnforcement) + all existing mutation tests pass under NOBYPASSRLS. Policy matrix: 7 tables × 4 policies = 28 total. | — |
| S-009 | Frontend campaign management UI | P3 | 🚧 S-009b done | — | S-009b: admin-web auth shell + API client (React 19, react-router-dom, vitest). Login/logout/session, protected routes, /me loading, sidebar nav, placeholder pages for campaigns/advertisers. Auth contract fix: login/refresh/logout use /api/v1/auth + credentials:include (HttpOnly cookie), no refresh_token in JSON body, LoginResponse/MeResponse match backend schemas. 17 tests (13 API contract + 4 auth-shell). Build passes (48 modules, 605ms). Next: S-009c campaign list/detail. | Wire campaign list/detail (S-009c) |
| S-009rr | Runtime truth gate — CI green baseline | P0 | ✅ done (local) | — | **Root cause**: device-gateway used `Depends(get_session)` with no engine wiring; `get_session(engine)` needs an explicit engine arg (not a FastAPI dep). Fix: added lifespan engine creation + `get_db()` dependency (matching control-api pattern). Also: device-gateway/requirements.txt (sqlalchemy, asyncpg, PyJWT), orchestrator-worker/requirements.txt (sqlalchemy, asyncpg), pop-ingestor/requirements.txt (empty, Dockerfile expects file). Compose: added ENVIRONMENT=dev, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, DATABASE_URL to device-gateway; added ENVIRONMENT to all services; added postgres health dependency to device-gateway. CI: added ENVIRONMENT=dev + JWT_SECRET to python-tests and import-boundaries jobs. Local baseline restored — **GitHub Actions verification pending after push**. | Push + verify GitHub Actions |
| S-015 | GitHub Release Versioning / Product Milestones | P1 | ✅ done | P.S. (Hermes) | Policy: `docs/architecture/release-versioning.md`. Tag v0.1-admin-campaign-mvp created at d291cfed. | — |
| S-016 | Dual Auth Readiness — local credentials + AD stub | P1 | 🚧 in progress | P.S. (Hermes) | `/me` DB-backed (username, display_name, must_change_password). Seed: local_credentials for break_glass_admin + advertiser_test with production gate (ENVIRONMENT=dev / SEED_DEV_CREDENTIALS=true). Admin-web: provider selector (ad/local_advertiser/local_break_glass), AD stub → 503 message. E2E tests: dual auth cycle, refresh/logout, break-glass audit. AD stays stub — honest 503. Runbook: `docs/runbook/clean-install-login.md`. | Behavioural proof with real PostgreSQL |
